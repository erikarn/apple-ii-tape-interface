# Tape binary format


The tape binary format is a simple TLV (type length value) block format.
The header is fixed and includes a 2 byte length field for the subsequent
data.  Unknown fields can be skipped.

All multi-byte fields are in little endian.

## TLV Format

The TLV format is as follows.

 * A header, consisting of <TYPE_BYTE> <ID BYTE> <LENGTH WORD>
 * Optional binary data, the length of <LENGTH WORD>

 * LENGTH WORD is the length of the data portion of the field, not
   including the TLV header itself.  It is in little endian.

 * TYPE_BYTE is 0xEF

 * ID BYTE is one of the following fields - PAUSE_BYTE, DATA_BYTE, DONE_BYTE

### PAUSE_BYTE

PAUSE_BYTE is 0x01 .  It has no optional data.

It signifies to the playback software that the playback should be paused at
this point until the PLAY button is again pressed.

### DATA_BYTE

DATA_BYTE is 0x02 . It has its own header and data.

 * TYPE_BYTE
 * DATA_BYTE
 * LENGTH_WORD - word; length of subsequent header information and tape data
 * NUMBER_PERIODS - byte; number of 128 cycle header periods. 31 is ~ 10 seconds.
 * PRE_BLANK - byte; number of 100ms intervals to wait before starting the header.
 * POST_BLANK - byte; number of 100ms intervals to wait once data is finished before
   starting the next data block.
 * START_ADDR - word; start address to load at; displayed at playback time.
 * END_ADDR - word; end address for loading; displayed at playback time.
 * DATA - variable length; this is the data to load into memory.

For now the START_ADDR is also the entry point for the program.


### DONE_BYTE

DONE_BYTE is 0x03 . It has no optional data.

It signifies that the tape playback has completed.
